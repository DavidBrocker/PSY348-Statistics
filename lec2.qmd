## Studying Psychology

### The Bobo Doll Experiment (Bandura, 1961)

### ![](images/bobo.png)

## Operationalization

> The process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon that is not directly measurable (AKA a latent variable) though its existence is implied by other phenomena.

## Operationalization

### Figuring out how to measure something you can't directly measure.

-   Attitudes, Beliefs, Thoughts

-   Behaviors

-   Brain activity

-   Performance/Abilities

## Operationalization

-   Self-Report OR Behavioral Measures

-   Observation

-   Implicit Measures

-   Tests OR Observation

## Self-report

-   AKA surveys

-   AKA questionnaires

## Self-Report

### What's wrong with this?

```{ojs}
//| echo: false

viewof survey = Inputs.radio(
  ["Best", "Greatest", "G.O.A.T"],
  {label: "Professor Brocker is the____"}
)
```

## Self-Report:

### Advantages

-   Most popular method of assessing attitudes[^1]

-   Can obtain large amounts of data

-   Quick

[^1]: In certain fields

## Self-Report:

### Disadvantages

Acquiescence

:   -   Tendency to say yes, true, agree

Social desirability

:   -   Tendency to respond in ways that are seen as socially acceptable

Demand characteristics

:   -   Tendency to response in ways that participant thinks researcher wants

## Self-report:

### Avoiding Disadvantages

<details>

Anonymous respondents are less likely to make things up

<summary>Assure anonymity</summary>

</details>

<details>

Allow respondents to answer in private

<summary>Allow for maximum privacy</summary>

</details>

<details>

Don't make your experiment too obvious/revealing

<summary>Obscure the true goal of the experiment</summary>

</details>

<details>

Add questions that test for respondent awareness

<summary>Include attention checks</summary>

</details>

<details>

Purposely make some questions opposite

<summary>Reverse coding</summary>

</details>

## Behavioral Measures

-   Taking a flier

-   Signing a petition

-   Internet Behavior [^2]

[^2]: Not a perfect stand-in!

## Observation

### The Bobo Doll Experiment (Bandura, 1961)

### ![](images/bobo.png)

## The Bobo Doll Experiment

### (Bandura, 1961)

-   Live aggression by adult

-   Videotaped aggression by adult

-   Cartoon aggression

    -   No aggression

## Observation

### Disadvantages

-   Time consuming

-   Different reviewers/observers may score behaviors differently.

    -   Coding scheme

    -   Inter-rater Reliability

## Implicit measures

### Brain activity

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

    -   neuroimaging of brain activity

        ![](images/fmri.png){width="163"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Electroencephalography (EEG)

    -   electrodes on surface of scalp measures brain activity

## Issues with Operationalization

### Why is it hard to measure psychological phenomena?

-   Others may choose to measure the phenomena differently from us

-   Operationalization can be culture-specific

-   What we measure is based on observable parts of the phenomena, but some parts may be unobservable

    -   Measuring only the observable/reportable is imprecise

## Operationalization

### How should we measure aggression in children?

-   Observer children for one hour and...

    -   **Label** them as Aggressive or Non-Aggressive

    -   **Rank** them from most aggressive to least aggressive

    -   **Score** them on a 10-point scale.

        -   1 = No Aggression

        -   10 = All of the Aggression

    -   **Count** number of aggressive behaviors

## Scales of measurement

-   **Labels**

-   **Rank**

-   **Scale**

-   **Count**

## Scales of measurement

-   Nominal

-   Order

-   Interval

-   Ratio

## Measurement scales: Nominal

### *Nominal, like name, refers to categories that CANNOT be ordered:*

-   Condition (experimental, control)

-   Gender

-   Major in college

-   Coffee drinker versus Non-coffee drinker (aka sociopath)

## Measurement scales: Ordinal

### *Ordinal, like order, refers to categories that CAN be ordered, but the space between each category isn't necessarily the same:*

-   Olympic Medals

-   Winner in a Race

-   Your rank in this class

## Measurement scales: Interval

### *Interval refers to ratings that are ordered where the interval between each rating is the same, but there is no real "0."*

-   Temperature\*

-   "On a scale of 1-10 How much do you agree with the following statement..."

## Measurement scales: Ratio

### Ratio, refers to ratings that are ordered, the interval between each rating is the same, and "0" means "0."

-   Length

-   Reaction Time

-   Dosage

## Ordinal Scales

-   Rarely used in psychological research, because it is hard to calculate variance when the interval between each number differs.

-   There are non-parametric statistics designed for ordinal scales, but we will not be covering those this semester.

## Interval vs Ratio

### What's the difference between interval and ratio?

-   Interval may have a 0 on the scale, but it doesn't mean the absence of something. A 0.0 GPA means an F rather than the absence of a grade.

-   Ratio has a 0 that. means 0 (the absence of something), like a '0' as a response to the questions, "How many drinks did you have last night?"

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

Undergraduates report their self-esteem on a scale of 1 to 10. Researchers assess the relationship of undergraduatesâ€™ self-esteem and GPA.

-   Predictor variable: **Self-Esteem** \| [Continuous (Interval)]{style="color:#006456"}

-   Outcome variable: **GPA** \| [Continuous (Interval)]{style="color:#006456"}

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

Participants are given a mystery drug or placebo and then asked to complete puzzle tasks. Researchers time how long participants take to complete the puzzles.

-   Independent variable: Drug vs. Placebo [Categorical (Nominal)]{style="color:#006456"}

-   Dependent variable: Reaction Time \| [Continuous (Ratio)]{style="color:#006456"}

## Determining Scale of measurement

### Identify the scale of measurement.

Undergraduates are shown either pictures of death or pictures of landscapes. They then report their anxiety about aging on a scale of 1 (none) to 10 (lots).

-   Independent variable: Pictures of death versus landscapes \| [Categorical (Nominal)]{style="color:#006456"}

-   Dependent variable: Anxiety about dying \| [Continuous (Interval)]{style="color:#006456"}

## WHY does scale of measurement matter?

-   Statistical tests can only be run on specific scales of measurement.

-   t-test & ANOVA: Nominal IV/predictor and Continuous DV/outcome

-   Correlation & Regression: All continuous

## Why does scale of measurement matter?

-   Generally, continuous variables (interval and ratio scales) lend themselves better to statistical analysis.

-   As a researcher, you should plan out your statistical analysis BEFORE conducting your study, so that you measure your variables in a way that matches the type of analyses you will run.

-   [TAKE AWAY]{.underline}: *How* we measure variables matters because it dictates what kind of statistical analyses we can run.

## Statistical terms & Symbols

![](images/eq.png)

## Statistical terms

Population

:   Every person in the group I am interested in studying

Sample

:   A small subset of people from the population who we will actually study in our experiment.

Parameter:

:   Information about the population.

Statistic

:   Information about the sample.

## Statistical Symbols

### Case-sensitive and often Greek

-   $n$ = the number of people in the sample

-   $x$ = one datapoint in a sample

-   $\bar{x}$ = Arithmetic mean (average) for a sample, x

-   $\Sigma(x)$ = The sum of all values in a sample, x

-   $\sum^{n}_{i = 1} = x_1 +x_2+x_3...$

## Practice 1

### Study Up!

> Esmeralda is taking Statistics for the Psychological Sciences. On her first exam, she scored 98. The average grade among the 26 students on that exam was 97

```{ojs}

viewof n = Inputs.text({
  label: "n", 
  placeholder: "Enter the value of n",
  width: "40%"
  })

viewof x = Inputs.text({
  label: "x", 
  placeholder: "Enter the value of x",
  width: "40%"
})

viewof xbar = Inputs.text({
  label: "xbar", 
  placeholder: "Enter the value of xbar",
  width: "40%"})
```

## Practice 2

### You Ever Heard of this show?

> Professor Brocker is interested in how many Farmingdale students watch the Netflix Original, Dark. He plans to ask 200 students if they have seen it or not.

```{ojs}
viewof pop = Inputs.text({
  label: "N", 
  placeholder: "",
  width: "40%"
  
})

viewof n2 = Inputs.text({
  label: "n", 
  placeholder: "",
  width: "40%"
  
})

viewof scale = Inputs.text({
  label: "Scale of measurment", 
  placeholder: "",
  width: "40%"
  
})

```

## Practice 3

### Be Kind to Yourself!

> A research study surveys 500 college student across 5 campuses in the United States, asking them to rate their self-esteem on a scale of 1 to 10.

```{ojs}

Inputs.text({
  label: "Sample", 
  placeholder: "",
  width: "40%"})

Inputs.text({
  label: "Population", 
  placeholder: "",
  width: "40%"})

Inputs.text({
  label: "Scale of measurment", 
  placeholder: "",
  width: "40%"})
```
